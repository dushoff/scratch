## Calculating scores from quantiles using the Johnson distribution

* [Code](https://github.com/dushoff/scratch/blob/v0.3/johnson.R)
* [Notes](http://dushoff.github.io/notebook/qbd.html)


To use, you can load the code.
```{r load}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dushoff/scratch/v0.3/johnson.R")
```

To evaluate a data point, you would use `jsqdens` to estimate the density at the observed point:

```{r example}
print(jsqdens(obs=195, q=c(7, 40, 122), P=0.5, logq=TRUE))
```

$q$ is the prediction with CIs; $P=0.5$ represents 50% CIs, and `logq` is used to do the calculation on the log scale (where it belongs for incidence; we might do something different for peak week, for example).

Since $q$ is passed as a separate parameter, you would probably want to use `plyr` to CURR
